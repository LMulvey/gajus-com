title: What makes great engineering teams?
---

## Incremental Movement

They advance in small steps. Ideally, engineers deploy to production multiple times a day, instead of long-term branch work.

## Embrace Mistakes

They understand higher throughput may cause more errors, but view mistakes as learning moments. Dwelling on past errors isn't productive.

## Remove Redundancy

They consistently remove unused code and features. A bloated codebase slows down deployment speed.

## Automate Standards

They use tools to enforce coding standards and conventions, as relying on manual documentation is often ineffective.

## Utilize Preview Environments

For each feature, they create temporary environments that closely replicate the production setup.

## Rely on Automated Testing

Comprehensive automated tests ensure reliable deployments, reducing the need for stakeholder involvement.

## Address Technical Debt

Counter to some beliefs, they prioritize managing technical debt. A strong foundation promotes rapid iteration, while a weak one can lead to bigger issues.

## Encourage Self-prioritization:

This optimizes value in every cycle and minimizes unfinished work.

## Value Communication

Quick and frequent communication is a vital metric indicating the health of the organization.

## Limit Tech Stack

They minimize the variety of technologies used. Using too many different languages, frameworks, or databases can cause bottlenecks due to specialized knowledge.

## Promote Cross-Functional Skills

Team members possess varied skills, allowing them to address diverse problems.

## Consistency Over Preferences

They value uniformity in processes and decisions over individual inclinations.
