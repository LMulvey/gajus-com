title: Designing one-to-one relationships in PostgreSQL
---

Once in a while, you might need to design a one-to-one relationship in SQL. This is a common pattern in database design, but it's not always straightforward to implement. In this article, I'll explain how to design one-to-one relationships in SQL and discuss some common pitfalls to avoid.

## What is a one-to-one relationship?

Let's define a clear use case for a one-to-one relationship.

Suppose you have `user_account` table.

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `id`          | `integer`    | Primary key |
| `name`        | `text`      | User's name |

A business requirement emerged that we need to sync the user's account with an external system (e.g. HubSpot). HubSpot assigns a unique identifier to each user, and we need to store this identifier in our database. We will call this identifier `hubspot_object_foreign_id`.

The first decision we need to make is how to store this identifier in our database. There are two common ways to do this:

## Option A: Add a column to the existing table

The first option is to add a column to the existing `user_account` table.

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `id`          | `integer`    | Primary key |
| `name`        | `text`      | User's name |
| `hubspot_object_foreign_id` | `text` | HubSpot's unique identifier |
| `hubspot_synced_at` | `timestamp with time zone` | Last time the user was synced with HubSpot |

This approach is simple and straightforward. If you only need to store a few additional columns, this is the way to go.

> [!NOTE]
> If you choose this option, you should add a unique constraint to the `hubspot_object_foreign_id` column to ensure that each user has a unique identifier.

The main disadvantage of this approach is that it can lead to a bloated table. If you need to store a lot of additional information about the relationship between the user account and the HubSpot account, it might be better to create a separate table.

### Performance considerations

Adding additional columns to the existing table can have performance implications. If the `user_account` table is large and you frequently query it, adding additional columns can slow down your queries. This is because the additional columns will increase the size of each row, which can lead to more disk I/O and memory usage.

> [!NOTE]
> How many is too many? It depends on the type of data you are storing (see [PostgreSQL limits](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/limits.html)). If I had to give a rough estimate, I would say that if you foresee storing more than 100 columns, you should steer clear of this approach.

## Option B: Create a separate table

The second option is to create a separate table (`user_account_hubspot_object`) to store the HubSpot identifier.

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `id`          | `integer`    | Primary key |
| `user_account_id` | `integer` | Foreign key to `user_account` |
| `hubspot_object_foreign_id` | `text` | HubSpot's unique identifier |
| `hubspot_synced_at` | `timestamp with time zone` | Last time the user was synced with HubSpot |
| `synced_phone_number` | `text` | User's phone number (data from HubSpot) |

The advantage of this approach is that it allows you to store additional information about the relationship between the user account and the HubSpot account. For example, in case of a two-way sync, you might need to store data that was added to HubSpot profile (`synced_phone_number`).

The disadvantages of this approach:

* It requires an additional join to retrieve the HubSpot identifier.
* It introduces an additional table, which can complicate the database schema.
* It requires additional logic to enforce the one-to-one relationship between the `user_account` and `user_account_hubspot_object` tables.

Option 2 is enticing because it keeps the `user_account` table clean and allows you to store additional information about the relationship between the user account and the HubSpot account. However, it introduces a new problem: how do you enforce the one-to-one relationship between the `user_account` and `user_account_hubspot_object` tables?

## Enforcing one-to-one relationship

This is where things get tricky. In SQL, there is no built-in way to enforce a one-to-one relationship between two tables.

You have a few options to enforce the one-to-one relationship (neither of them is perfect):

### Option 1: Use a unique index

You can add a unique index to the `user_account_id` column in the `user_account_hubspot_object` table. This will ensure that each user account has at most one corresponding HubSpot object.

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX user_account_hubspot_object_user_account_id_idx
ON user_account_hubspot_object (user_account_id);
```

The disadvantages of this approach is that there is no way to tell just by looking at the query referencing the `user_account_hubspot_object` table that it is a one-to-one relationship. You have to rely on the fact that the unique index is there. This can lead to the confusion and bugs down the line. Example: suppose that somewhere in our application we have a query that joins `user_account` and `user_account_hubspot_object` tables.

```sql
SELECT
  ua1.id,
  ua1.name,
  uaho1.hubspot_object_foreign_id
FROM user_account ua1
INNER JOIN user_account_hubspot_object uaho1
ON uaho1.user_account_id = ua1.id
/* ... */
```

Now suppose that a new business requirement emerges that if a HubSpot object is deleted, the corresponding relation in the `user_account_hubspot_object` table should be marked as deleted. The developer who is tasked to implement this requirement might not be aware aware (have access to) every code path that references the `user_account_hubspot_object` table. As a result, they might think it is safe to drop the unique index and add a `deleted_at` column to the `user_account_hubspot_object` table. This will break the one-to-one relationship between the `user_account` and `user_account_hubspot_object` tables. Every query that references this table will now produce incorrect results.

> [!NOTE]
> This wouldn't be such a huge problem if PostgreSQL natively supported [assertions about the query output](https://gajus.com/blog/the-case-for-native-assertions-in-postgresql). However, it doesn't, so we have to be extra careful when picking this approach.

### Option 2: Using foreign key as the primary key

You can enforce the one-to-one relationship by using the foreign key as the primary key in the `user_account_hubspot_object` table.

Our `user_account_hubspot_object` table would look like this:

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `user_account_id` | `integer` | Primary key and foreign key to `user_account` |
| `hubspot_object_foreign_id` | `text` | HubSpot's unique identifier |
| `hubspot_synced_at` | `timestamp with time zone` | Last time the user was synced with HubSpot |

This approach enforces the one-to-one relationship between the `user_account` and `user_account_hubspot_object` tables. The table design makes it clear that `user_account_id` is the primary key and therefore it is highly unlikely that this table would ever be refactored to support a one-to-many relationship.

However, just like the 1st option, this approach has the disadvantage that there is no way to tell just by looking at the query referencing the `user_account_hubspot_object` table that it is a one-to-one relationship.

### Option 3: Use a unique index and a naming convention

You can somewhat mitigate the risk of the latter scenario by using a naming convention that indicates that the relationship is one-to-one. For example, you can prefix the table name with `oto_` (one-to-one).

It is a lot easier to spot the one-to-one relationship in the query if the table name is `oto_user_account_hubspot_object` instead of `user_account_hubspot_object`.

This approach also makes it clear to whoever reads the query that the relationship between the `user_account` and `user_account_hubspot_object` tables is one-to-one. Example:

```sql
SELECT
  ua1.id,
  ua1.name,
  uaho1.hubspot_object_foreign_id
FROM user_account ua1
INNER JOIN oto_user_account_hubspot_object uaho1
ON uaho1.user_account_id = ua1.id
/* ... */
```

If you have a naming convention that indicates that the relationship is one-to-one, it will be easier for developers to understand the relationship between the tables. However, this approach is not foolproof. Developers can still drop the unique index without understanding the implications.

### Option 4: Identify the associated row in the table that owns the relationship

You can enforce the one-to-one relationship by mandating that the table that owns the relationship (in our case, `user_account`) has a column that references the associated row in the other table (`user_account_hubspot_object`), e.g.

`user_account` table:

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `id`          | `integer`    | Primary key |
| `name`        | `text`      | User's name |
| `user_account_hubspot_object_id` | `integer` | Foreign key to `user_account_hubspot_object` |

This is my preferred approach because it allows `user_account` itself to document the relationship with `user_account_hubspot_object`. It also makes it clear to whoever reads the query that the relationship between the `user_account` and `user_account_hubspot_object` tables is one-to-one. Example:

```sql
SELECT
  ua1.id,
  ua1.name,
  uaho1.hubspot_object_foreign_id
FROM user_account ua1
INNER JOIN user_account_hubspot_object uaho1
ON uaho1.id = ua1.user_account_hubspot_object_id
/* ... */
```

The disadvantage of this approach is that there is nothing stopping someone from unknowingly constructing a query that joins `user_account` and `user_account_hubspot_object` tables on a column other than `user_account_hubspot_object_id`. This can lead to bugs and incorrect results.

## The best approach

The point of this article is to introduce you to the various ways you can design a one-to-one relationship in SQL and the trade-offs involved. The best approach depends on your specific use case and the constraints you are working with. Historically, I've used a separate table and identified the associated row in the table that owns the relationship (the 4th option) because it makes the relationship explicit and easy to understand. However, as demonstrated, it is not foolproof. Meanwhile, most SQL purists (based on my conversations) would argue that using a junction table to express the one-to-one relationship is wrong to begin with. They would argue that you should just add the additional columns to the existing table and be done with it. This is a valid point of view, but it doesn't work in all cases (see notes about performance).

In the end, the best approach is the one that works best for your specific use case and your team's constraints. The most important thing is to be aware of the trade-offs involved, commit to a consistent approach, and document your decisions so that other developers can understand the database schema.
