title: How to enable open telemetry logs?
---

Frustratingly, @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node does not log anything by default.

Their documentation also misleads you into thinking that you can enable logs by setting the `OTEL_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `debug` or `trace`.

https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/js/automatic/

I have not been successful with those approaches.

The only thing that worked was to manually configure the logger:

```ts
const { diag, DiagConsoleLogger, DiagLogLevel } = require('@opentelemetry/api');
const { getNodeAutoInstrumentations } = require('@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node');

diag.setLogger(new DiagConsoleLogger(), DiagLogLevel.DEBUG);

getNodeAutoInstrumentations();

// ...
```
